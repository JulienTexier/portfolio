        <p>
          I‚Äôve always had a thing for creating‚Äîwhether it was crafting music,
          editing travel videos, or imagining a new business. The thrill of
          building something from scratch has always captivated me. During my
          business school days, a friend and I dreamed up a company, and I
          eagerly volunteered to handle the technical side of things. There was
          just one small problem: I had absolutely no idea what I was doing.
        </p>
        <p>
          But, hey, ‚Äúfake it ‚Äôtil you make it,‚Äù right? So, I jumped into a
          peer-to-peer bootcamp to back up my spontaneous CTO title with some
          real skills. It was an exhilarating experience. The company itself
          never really took off, but the real magic of that project was that I
          discovered a love for coding that‚Äôs stuck with me ever since.
        </p>
        <p>
          Fast forward a bit: I fell in love (the real kind of love) with an
          incredible Finnish girl while in Portugal, and after a few years of
          living abroad, we made the leap to Finland together. Somewhere between
          adjusting to a new country and (trying to) learn a new language, I
          somehow showcased my skills to the right person at the right time.
          Next thing I knew, I had an offer for a full-stack engineer position ‚Äî
          something I never imagined possible with just a 3-month bootcamp
          behind me.
        </p>
        <p>
          I found a special passion for mobile development, and it quickly
          became my focus. Years have passed since then, but the thrill of
          solving problems, building something meaningful, and watching it come
          to life on a screen hasn‚Äôt faded one bit.
        </p>
        <p>
          Today, I‚Äôm still that same creator at heart, always on the hunt for
          more knowledge, fresh challenges, and fun projects that make the hours
          disappear.
        </p>

## Overview

During the Hack Junction event, I collaborated with my team to develop MoveMania, a game designed to enhance the well-being of school-age children by promoting physical activity and fostering community spirit. Understanding the crucial role of connection and support in childhood development, MoveMania inspires adventure and teamwork, creating a vibrant environment for kids.

> Please note that this app was developed exclusively for the hackathon and is not available for public use.

## Key Features

- **Team Building**: Classes can form unique teams, fostering collaboration among classmates.
- **Exploration and Rewards**: Every step unlocks new adventures and treasures, such as coins and gems.
- **Celebrating Milestones**: Completing levels allows players to celebrate their classmates with unique compliment badges, recognizing their strengths and achievements.
- **Team Power**: Walking together activates a 'boost' feature, enhancing gameplay and promoting excitement among players.

## Technologies Used

- **React Native**: For building a cross-platform mobile application that engages users.
- **GPS Integration**: To track movements and facilitate gameplay based on user location.
- **H3 Library**: For implementing intricate tile logic on maps, enhancing the user experience.
- **Adaptable Reward System**: Allows for easy tweaking of reward types and probabilities via app settings.

## Challenges and Learnings

One of the biggest challenges was creating a seamless experience without a backend. We designed the game to function effectively while acknowledging that a robust backend is necessary for user data storage and communication. Additionally, implementing the H3 library for mapping added complexity but also enriched gameplay.

## Outcome

MoveMania has transformed the concept of physical activity into a shared adventure, encouraging children to move while strengthening their bonds with peers. The game fosters a happier, healthier community, making every step count towards collective joy and well-being. **However, since MoveMania was developed solely for the Hack Junction hackathon, it remains a prototype and is not available for public release.**
